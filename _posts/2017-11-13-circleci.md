Learn how to setup continuous integration for all 5 Parts Unlimited MRP microservices and Front end webserver utilizing CircleCI.  This builds and unit tests the code, creates 6 docker images, and pushes the images to a private docker Azure container registry.

### Prerequisites

1. A personal GitHub account
1. A personal CircleCI account
  > Note: Signup using your personal GitHub account and be sure to allow CircleCI access to your personal repository.
1. An existing Kubernetes cluster and docker private registry This is covered in tasks 1-2 of the [Deploy to ACS with K8s using Helm HOL](https://microsoft.github.io/PartsUnlimitedMRPmicro/hols/deploy-acs-kubernetes-helm.html)

### Tasks Overview

1. Fork the GitHub repository
1. Configure CircleCI
1. Trigger a CircleCI Build

## Task 1. Fork the GitHub

**Step 1.** Fork [the repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimitedMRPmicro) to your personal GitHub repository.

## Task 2. Configure CircleCI

**Step 1.** Configure CircleCI to build the forked project.

Go to Projects - _your-GitHub-repo_  - Setup project - **PartsUnlimitedMRPmicro** - "Start building"

**Step 2.** Add ENV variables for Azure Container Registry

In the CircleCI dashboard, go to Settings - Environment variables and then add the following environment variables:

- `DOCKER_PASS` - the ACR admin username
- `DOCKER_USER` - the ACR admin password
- `REGISTRY_NAME` - the ACR base URL i.e. `pumrpmicro.azurecr.io`
- `REGISTRY_NAMEIMAGE` - the subfolder path to store images in ACR. `pumrp` is a good name to set.

## Task 3. Trigger CircleCI Build



## Conclusion

This lab walked through how to completely automate from check-in of code to build and test all the microservices and push the docker images to Azure Container Registry. Next, consider completing the HOL on Fluentd, Prometheus monitoring, or Open Tracing.
