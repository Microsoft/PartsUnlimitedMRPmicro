# Parts Unlimited MRP Microservices

Parts Unlimited MRP Microservices is a fictional outsourced Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP) application for training purposes based on the description in chapters 31-35 of The Phoenix Projectby Gene Kim, Kevin Behr and George Spafford. © 2013 IT Revolution Press LLC, Portland, OR. Resemblance to “Project Unicorn” in the novel is intentional; resemblance to any real company is purely coincidental.

This microservices-based application uses entirely open source software including Docker, Kubernetes, Java, Apache, Hystrix, and MongoDB which creates a web front end and 5 supporting microservices. Click here for the related [Parts Unlimited Website application](http://microsoft.github.io/PartsUnlimited/) which is .Net Core and SQL Azure based or here for the same [Parts Unlimited MRP application](http://aka.ms/pumrplabs) except with everything running on a single Azure Linux VM (IaaS) without a microservices architecture.

## Key Features

- Entire application is dockerized and runs on Azure Container Service with Kubernetes orchestrator
- Front end website - runs Apache Tomcat and talks to all microservices services utilizing Hystrix and JSP.
- Catalog, Order, Shipment, and Quote microservices - are Java spring APIs and call DocDb using the MongoDB driver.
- Dealer microservice - is a .Net Core API using C#

## Hands On Labs

All of these labs utilize the application designed to run on top of Kubernetes.  Here are the recommended lab options for starting out:

1. [Deployment to Azure Container Service with Kubernetes using Helm]({{ site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2017-04-24-deploy-acs-kubernetes-helm %}) - this is best to become familiar with ACS and Helm and has the prerequisite steps necessary for any HOL, namely provisioning ACS/K8s, ACR, and DocDB with MongoDB driver.
1. [CI with CircleCI and Azure Container Registry]({{ site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2017-11-13-circleci %}) - builds and tests all 6 docker images then deploys them to ACR using CircleCI 
1. Deploy, monitor, and scale using Deis Workflow (Front end website only) - this is best to understand benefits of using Deis workflow.  Only the front-end website is deployed, but offers insight into how things like logging, monitoring, routing, and DevOps practices are made easier versus the more manual implementation route highlighted in the other labs here.

After completion of lab 1 or 2 above or essentially all services have been deployed to the Kubernetes cluster, then the following labs are able to be completed in any desired order:

- Implement Fluentd logging
- Implement Monitoring and Alerts with Prometheus
- Implement Opentracing using Zipkin
